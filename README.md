Imagine you have a list of 100 keywords you want to rank for on Google. For each one, you need to
ask:
1. Are we already ranking for this keyword? If so, where?
2. If we are ranking, is the page fully optimized?
3. If not, what specific optimization does it need (Title, Content, etc.)?
Doing this manually is incredibly time-consuming and repetitive. This tool solves that problem.
It is a smart system built with Python and Selenium that automates the entire process. It reads a
keyword from your Google Sheet, finds its current Google rank for your website, and then visits the
ranking page to perform a detailed on-page SEO analysis. It identifies specific opportunities—like
missing content or a poorly written title—and records its findings directly back into your Google
Sheet.
